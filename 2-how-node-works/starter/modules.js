// So arguments is an array in JavaScript, and this array contains all the values that were passed into a function. So when I log this arguments array to the console, if we actually see some values there, well, then it means that we're really in a function, okay? So let's run modules. And indeed, here we have the code in our
console.log(arguments);
// And so let's remember the five arguments of the wrapper function. The first one is the export, so this one, which is currently empty because we're not exporting anything. The second one is the require function, so we can see that here, we have the require function indeed. Then the third one is called module, okay. And in module we have then module exports, which again we talked about in the last lecture. And what do we have here is not that important, again, I just wanted to show you that we're actually in a function right now, so that all this code that we have in this module is indeed wrapped into this wrapper function, okay? Then number three and number four are the filename and the directory name. And indeed, this is the name of the module that we're currently in, so modules.js. And then here we have the directory name. So I'm on my desktop, and then in this now Node works folder. So similar to this one here, but then this one has slash the module name, okay? So that proves us that, indeed, all the code inside a module is wrapped, and that we have access to all these variables, so these arguments, okay? So I just find this an interesting experiment that we can do. And we can actually do another cool thing. So to actually show you the wrapper function, we can require the module module, okay. So there's a module called module, which we actually never used but internally Node uses it. And in there we have the wrapper. And so that is actually this property is actually the wrapper function. So we can now take a look at that. And where is that, ah, yeah. So here, here it is actually. So this is the wrapper function.
console.log(require("module").wrapper);
// the output of the above console.log is this.
// '(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { ',
//   '\n});'
